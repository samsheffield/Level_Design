# WHAT IS A LEVEL ? ?
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- What is a level? and other working definitions
- Level Design Construction Kit

## Introduce yourself
Let's go around the room and introduce ourselves:
- Name and pronouns ("Hi, I'm Sam (he/him)")

## What is a level?
- Some definitions
- Visual hierarchy and intuition
- Notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Leji7OVc_9DuYgsPoSwm7uGeZD8W0wSBjvyeK6waoUg/edit?usp=sharing)

## Open studio: Level Construction Kit
- Open studio until 9pm tonight
- You are welcome to work here or from home (just let me know!)

**If you work from home you will be required to email me the following at the end of class:**
- A brief description of what you worked on during open studio hours
- 3 forms of documentation (screenshots, scripts)


# Homework

## Two choices this week...
1. Global Game Jam
2. Work on Level Construction Kit

If you participate in the GGJ, send me a link to your completed game for homework credit this week. Otherwise, upload a build of your progress on your Level Construction Kit by start of class next week.

### Google Drive
I'll send you a link to your class Google Drive this week!

## Global Game Jam
It's that time again! Maybe warm up for the semester with a little project this weekend? With [this super secret (not-so-secret) theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6on52GnVE0w)?
- The event kicks off at 5pm on Friday and ends at 5pm on Sunday
- Head over to the MICA Game Lab Discord if you're looking to join a team!

## Level Construction Kit (Due 02/08)
As preparation for your level design work, you will need to build yourself a level construction set. This kit will provide the framework for your work this semester that you can add to, remix, or combine with others when collaborating.

You will need to create:
1.  A player character with animations and controller script
    - Your player must be able to MOVE. *It's up to you to decide how!*
    - Your player character must have one action (a verb!) through which they can interact with enemies. For instance, it could SHOOT them, REPEL them a limited number of times, or BECOME INTANGIBLE temporarily.
    - Make this a prefab.
    - **You can rely on some of [these scripts](https://github.com/samsheffield/2D_Game_Design/tree/Fall_21/Standalone%20Scripts) if you want to work in 2D**
2. Two distinct Sources of Conflict (like enemies) with animations and behavior scripts
    - Make these into prefabs
    - These *Sources of Conflict* must have distinct behaviors, not just variations.
3. One collectible prefab (like a coin) with script to handle players *collecting* them.
    - Make this a prefab
4. Four obstacle placeholder graphics (like a wall). *Sprites for 2D, Materials for 3D*
5. For space placeholder graphics (like a floor). *Sprites for 2D, Materials for 3D*
6. One goal item prefab with script that can be *triggered* by the player
7. A special prefab that is one of the above, but modified with an adjective of your choosing. Examples:
    - A *false* goal
    - A *breakable* obstacle
    - A *friendly* source of conflict

### Some Guidance
These don't need to be the most interesting or precious combinations of things. They just need to be a starting point for us to do some work together. The more you view them as placeholders, the easier it will be to update/change/replace them as needed. But also don't make them so generic that you can't develop some meaningful relationships between them. *You're really threading a needle with this one!*

#### This is due in two weeks (02/08)
A test scene in Unity that demonstrates that all of the above work correctly. Not a game.

#### This is due next week if you don't do the GGJ
A test scene in Unity which shows the progress you made on your kit this week.

#### Testing & uploading
- Please upload tested Windows/Mac **builds** of your test scene to your class Google Drive folder. If you don't have either a Mac or PC to test your build, use one of ours, or ask for help on our Discord!
