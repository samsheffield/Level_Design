## Prototype 3: Work on Week 2 Goals

### Pre-production goals:
- What are your player experience goals for your level?
- What is the pillar (central player experience goal) for your level?
- What else do you want in your level?
- __Identify at least one example of a similar puzzle working successfully in another game__

### Layout goals:
- Develop 6 parti thumbnails/sketches (quick ideas)
- Develop 3 bubble diagrams based on the partis you find most interesting
- Develop a floor plan based on your most promising bubble diagram with details on puzzle elements, mechanics, important game objects, and your levelâ€™s critical path 

__Once you've done this, feel free to begin implementing your level in Unity!__

## Homework: 
Create a pre-production design document which collects your pre-production and layout work and upload it to your Google Drive folder by the start of class on 04/26.
