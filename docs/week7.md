# HELLO!
Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Playtest finished levels & give general feedback

## Playtesting Requirements
This needs to be done before we get started this afternoon:
1. Link to __tested__ builds on the MICA Game Lab Discord on a playtesting channel. (Please don't upload anything you haven't tested!)
2. Screenshot of your game included in the Discord post.
3. Link to an online playtesting form for your level.

## Playtesting Session
Take turns playtesting each other's games in groups. The goal is to playtest each of the games _for your group_ in class and finish any remaining for homework. 

This is always tricky in large classes, but here's what I suggest:
- Download each team member's game from the MGL Discord
- Take turns running a playtest for each game
    - Roughly 15-20 minutes for each
    - Everyone in your group should provide feedback and testing
- Designers...
    - Observe and take notes during playtest
    - Ask playtesting questions or direct playtesters to your playtesting form
    - Discuss your concept & player experience goals afterwards
- Playtesters...
    - Respond to specific playtesting questions first
    - Give general feedback on your experience and how effectively the designer met the design goal of a reversible level 

### Playtesting Groups for Prototype 1

# Homework

## Finish playtesting games on MGL Discord and leave feedback
You are only responsible for testing your group's games, but feel free to check out everyone else's work and leave feedback if you'd like!

_If there is no feedback form, you can leave feedback as a reply to the designer's post in the playtesting channel._

## Organize all Prototype 1 Work
Organize all work related to Prototype 1 in your Google Drive folder:
- Make a __Planning__  folder and include:
    - Planning docs & floor plans (prototyping week 1)
    - First pass at greyboxing/blocking out ((prototyping week 2))
- Make a __Builds__ folder with:
    - Finished prototype builds which you shared this week

### One additional thing to add to your Planning folder:
- Create a text document which describes...
    - Your concept for a reversible level involving something different for a player to experience on their return to the start of the level.
    - One additional player experience goal you were designing in your level.
