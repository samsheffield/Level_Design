# HELLO!
Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Playtest finished levels & give general feedback

## Playtesting Requirements
This needs to be done before we get started this afternoon:
1. Link to __tested__ builds on the MICA Game Lab Discord on a playtesting channel. (Please don't upload anything you haven't tested!)
2. Screenshot of your game included in the Discord post.
3. Link to an online playtesting form for your level.

## Playtesting Session
Take turns playtesting each other's games in groups. The goal is to playtest each of the games _for your group_ in class and finish any remaining for homework. 

This is always tricky in large classes, but here's what I suggest:
- Download each team member's game from the MGL Discord
- Take turns running a playtest for each game
    - Roughly 15 minutes for each
    - Everyone in your group should provide feedback
- Designers...
    - Ask playtesting questions or direct playtesters to your playtesting form
    - Discuss your concept & player experience goals afterwards
- Playtesters...
    - Respond to specific playtesting questions first
    - Give general feedback on your experience and how effectively the designer met the design goal of a reversible level

# Homework

## Organize all Prototype 1 Work
Organize all work related to Prototype 1 in your Google Drive folder:
- Make a __Planning__  folder and include:
    - Planning docs & floor plans (prototyping week 1)
    - First pass at greyboxing/blocking out (prototyping week 2)
- Make a __Builds__ folder with:
    - Finished prototype builds which you shared this week (if you didn't have builds ready for this evening it is considered late, so have this uploaded ASAP)

### One additional thing to add to your Planning folder:
- Create a text document which describes...
    - Your concept for a reversible level involving something different for a player to experience on their return to the start of the level.
    - One additional player experience goal you were designing in your level.

## ABSENT??? Playtest games on MGL Discord and leave feedback
__If you were absent tonight:__
You are responsible for testing your group's games. _If there is no feedback form, you can leave feedback as a reply to the designer's post in the playtesting channel._
