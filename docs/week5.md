# HELLO AGAIN
Hope you're all staying healthy! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Review level layout and planning
- Layout methodologies: Blockouts and greyboxing

# Pre-production Share Session (40 minutes)
Break into small groups (max 4 people) to share & discuss the level concepts & floorplans you developed for homework. 

_You do not need to discuss every parti and bubble diagram you made, just focus on where you ended up._

## Want to discuss your plans with me?

Sign up for some time _after_ our dinner break [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NkQ9CR_hBparfNDYFr_HG559JDURdgEMQ9LJHPhJZnU/edit?usp=sharing). We can meet in-person or on Discord.

Note: This is an optional meeting. Sign up for the next available slot _before_ leaving for dinner.

# Level Layout: Blocking out & Greyboxing

## Blockouts & Greyboxes
A _blockout_ or _greybox_ is a rough draft of a level built quickly using simple shapes and without refined art assets.

These two terms come from 3D level design but their concepts and utility are certainly applicable to 2D games as well.

Fundamentally, they are tools for experimentation and design implementation.

## Prototype 1: Reversible Level (Due 03/01)
__Implementation goals:__

- Create a sandbox for understanding your playerâ€™s metrics and core mechanics
- Block out level in Unity. This should be the result of several small iterative passes.

# Homework

## Upload This Week's Homework
Haven't uploaded the pre-production & layout doc to your class Drive folder yet? Do it today for full credit.

## Prototype 1: Complete Week 2 Goals (Due 02/22) 

Develop a playable beta of your level and upload Mac & PC builds to your Google Drive folder by the start of class on 02/22. Have shareable links ready for in-class playtesting. _See full project description above for list pre-production and layout goals._

## Next week: Bo Ruberg talk on Wednesday (02/23) @ 2:30!!

__Video Games to Play after the End of the World: Queer Visions of the Post-Apocalypse__

In this talk, Prof. Bo Ruberg will discuss the rich intersections between queerness and video games. After offering an introduction to queer game studies and queer indie make making, they will dive into the topic of apocalypses and post-apocalypses in video games. Apocalyptic themes are pervasive across game genres. Now, under the shadow of climate collapse and the current pandemic, a growing number of independent queer and trans game designers are using scenes of the end of the world to explore alternate forms of identity, community, and society. Here, Ruberg explains how apocalypses and post-apocalypses take on queer meaning in video games, and how they show us the possibility for creating a new, queerer world after the one that we know today has ended.

And here's a bio:

Dr. Bo Ruberg (they/them) is an associate professor in the Department of Film and Media Studies and an affiliate faculty member in the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, as well as the incoming co-editor of the Journal of Cinema and Media Studies. Their research explores gender and sexuality in digital media and digital cultures. They are the author of three monographs: Video Games Have Always Been Queer (NYU Press, 2019), The Queer Games Avant-Garde: How LGBTQ Game Makers Are Reimagining the Medium of Video Games (2020), and Sex Dolls at Sea: Imagined Histories of Sexual Technologies (MIT Press, 2022). They are also the co-editor of Queer Game Studies (University of Minnesota Press, 2017) and Live Streaming Culture (MIT Press, forthcoming). 

Open to current MICA students. __Be on the lookout for a ZOOM link and calendar invite via email!__
