## Prototype 3 Weekly Goals

### Prototype 3 Implementation goals:
- Block out level in Unity. This should be the result of several small iterative passes.
- Replace successfully blocked out elements with in-game assets.

### Playtesting goals:
- Develop 3 playtesting questions and create an online form

### Prototype 3 deliverable (05/03):
- Tested Mac or PC build of your level uploaded to your Google Drive folder (each team memberâ€™s folder)
- A readme.txt file which includes instructions, controls, and list of known bugs
- A playtesting form using Google Forms to collect playtesting feedback

## Homework: 
Develop a playable beta of your level and have it on your laptop for testing by the start of class on 05/03. Have shareable links for playtesting questions ready.
