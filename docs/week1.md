# W E L C O M E &nbsp; B A C K ! !
So excited to welcome you all back. Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Say hello!
- Discuss this class ([Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/132CrDZhnPa9t9ApqyYeD_FbvqzooSSl86dvlHDPi5S8/edit?usp=sharing), Hybrid structure, Expectations and responsibilities)
- Any other concerns or questions? (This class, this semester, ...uhh, averything!)

__Homework__
- Join the class Discord server ([link](https://discord.gg/KVQJBdHbeK)) and the MICA Game Lab Discord server([link](https://discord.gg/hpGgwpX8sQ)). Set your server nickname to what you want to be called in class and then...

## Introduce yourself
Introduce yourself on the class Discord:
- Name and pronouns ("Hi, I'm Sam (he/him)")
- Your major and year ("Game Design Senior")
- One example of a game you worked on recently (Include a link to a working build or a short video)
- One example of a game you played recently and a brief thought on it ("I've played a little Wordle recently and was interested in the idea of making a game for another person. It also reminds me of this game show called Lingo which I used to enjoy.")
- One example of something you're interested that is not related to games (Include a link to an example)

## Update Unity
Let's standardize our primary tool for this class. This will make it easier to collaborate and get help. As of the start of the semester this is 2021.2.8, which can be installed using Unity Hub. If you have a new M1 Mac, make sure to install the Silicon version, otherwise, some of our tools (like Probuilder) will be really miserable to use!

*Note: it's okay/normal to have multiple Unity installations on your computer. Just be sure to select 2021.2.8 when you create a new project in Unity Hub.

## Read The History of the Level Designer
Read this short chapter from The Level Design Book, which provides a very specific overview of early computer game level design.
