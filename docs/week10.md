# HELLO!
Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Share/review layouts and planning
- Discuss denial spaces and pacing
- Work session

## Pre-production and Planning Share Session
Break into small groups (max 4 people) to share & discuss the level concepts & floorplans you developed for homework. In particular, focus on how these plans relate to your player experience goals.

_You do not need to discuss every parti and bubble diagram you made, just focus on where you ended up._

__Any volunteers to share with class?__


## Spaces of Denial & Pacing

Tonight's notes on gating, denial spaces, & pacing can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JLYBAvMto9vC83PEom7AkYJnVJ_Do2DD7aBz7Fiu4ak/edit?usp=sharing)

## Work Session: Prototype 2
- Let me know if you want to meet to review/discuss your planning and layouts
- Check in by the end of the night via email if you decide to work remotely. 

### Implementation goals:
1. Block out level in Unity. This should be the result of several small iterative passes.
2. Replace successfully blocked out elements with in-game assets.

### Playtesting goals:
- Develop 3 playtesting questions and create an online form to share with classmates next week
- Please consider what you want to improve & get _actual_ feedback on next week
