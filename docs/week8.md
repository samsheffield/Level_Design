# HELLO!
Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Wayfinding
- Discuss Prototype 2

## Still reviewing Prototype 1
I'm still reviewing your prototypes, recording playthroughs, and taking notes. Looks like I will be finishing them up during Spring Break!

## Wayfinding
_Wayfinding_ refers to a process a player uses to find where they are, or where they are going.

[This week's notes on wayfinding can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19BtLMW8quQ6ePuEEcPJWKDVTG2F-PcFbNF37MKz_gg8/edit?usp=sharing)

## Prototype 2: Narrative Level (Due 04/05)
Using your level design construction kit, build a single level which communicates these 3 specific facts to your player:
1. Something that happened to the protagonist of the game in the past.

2. Something that happened to a character who is somehow related to the protagonist (for instance: a sibling, friend, enemy, or rival).

3. Something about the world in which the game takes place.

__You are allowed to work in self-selected pairs for this prototype (combining components from level construction kits).__

## After dinner plans
### Begin brainstorming
Your brainstorming goals for tonight:
- What's your level's overall concept?
- What are your 3 facts?
- What assets do you need to reskin or make?

### Need assistance?
- Having any issues? 
- Want to talk about Prototype 1? 

Sign up for some time _after_ our dinner break [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NkQ9CR_hBparfNDYFr_HG559JDURdgEMQ9LJHPhJZnU/edit?usp=sharing). We can meet in-person or on Discord.

# Homework

Email me a document with your brainstorming ideas and 3 facts by the end of the night (_ideal_) or by Friday (_at absolute latest_).

## Spring Break
Enjoy a nice Spring Break everyone! Don't work on any Level Design related work.
