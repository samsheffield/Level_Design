# HELLO!
Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Playtest level blockouts

# Playtesting (Before dinner at 5:40)
Take turns playtesting each other's games:
- Host the playtest on your own computer
- Observe your player and take notes
- Conduct post-playtest interview

If I am unable to play your game before dinner, you can sign up for some time _after_ our dinner break [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NkQ9CR_hBparfNDYFr_HG559JDURdgEMQ9LJHPhJZnU/edit?usp=sharing). We can meet in-person or on Discord.

Note: This is an _optional meeting_. Sign up for the next available slot _before_ leaving for dinner and I will assign a specific time before the end of the break.

## Playtesting Tips

### Be prepared
- Have post-playtest questions ready
- Provide build notes with descriptions of controls, additional instructions, known bugs (and how to avoid/overcome them), and scope of playtest.
- Have note taking materials

### Don't explain too much
This is really difficult to do, but planning ahead of time and frequently playtesting can help it feel less awkward. Instead...

### Observe
Watch your playtesters:
- Provide instructions and guidance upfront. Key things should not be a mystery! 
- If you're explaining or guiding a player it means something isn't clear or isn't working.
- Don't distract your playtesters with conversation.
- Don't interfere.

### Take notes
Make sure that you are taking notes throughout the playtest:
- What do you observe? What is a player's behavior? What do they say? What things didn't they understand?
- Keep track of time (How long did it take to play?)
- Follow-up after playtest on notable things you observe
- You might find it helpful to record play sessions to review later

### Post-Playtest Interview
Have a small number of questions to ask your playtesters after they finish. If necessary, ask additional questions based on what you observed.

- Prepare your questions beforehand
- Don't overwhelm your playtesters
- Don't be defensive
- Don't explain
- Avoid technical game dev jargon
- Write down answers

[Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) is pretty good for this and easy to set up. 

### Evaluate your playtets
Don't forget to assess you playtets and determine how to move forward:
- What was successful and how can you amplify this?
- What can you actually fix?
- What should be removed because it doen't work and can't be fixed?

# Homework

## Upload This Week's Homework
Haven't uploaded the level blockout and sandbox scenes to your class Drive folder yet? Do it today for full credit.

## Prototype 1: Complete Week 3 Goals (Due 03/01) 

Complete development of your level and upload Mac & PC builds to your Google Drive folder by the start of class on 03/01. Final playtesting will take place in-class and online for homework next week.

### Deliverable
- Tested Mac & PC builds of your level uploaded to your Google Drive folder. Sharing needs to be turned on.
- Build notes: A readme.txt file which includes instructions, controls, and list of known bugs
- A playtesting form using Google Forms to collect playtesting feedback

Upload links to a folder with tested builds & playtesting forms shared on the MICA Game Lab Discord (__this is not our class Discord__) in one of the playtesting text channels. Here's a link to join that server if you did not do so already ([link](https://discord.com/invite/hpGgwpX8sQ)) Include a screenshot of your game which is not a title screen with your post. 


## WEDNESDAY: Bo Ruberg talk on Wednesday (02/23) @ 2:30!!

__Video Games to Play after the End of the World: Queer Visions of the Post-Apocalypse__

In this talk, Prof. Bo Ruberg will discuss the rich intersections between queerness and video games. After offering an introduction to queer game studies and queer indie make making, they will dive into the topic of apocalypses and post-apocalypses in video games. Apocalyptic themes are pervasive across game genres. Now, under the shadow of climate collapse and the current pandemic, a growing number of independent queer and trans game designers are using scenes of the end of the world to explore alternate forms of identity, community, and society. Here, Ruberg explains how apocalypses and post-apocalypses take on queer meaning in video games, and how they show us the possibility for creating a new, queerer world after the one that we know today has ended.

And here's a bio:

Dr. Bo Ruberg (they/them) is an associate professor in the Department of Film and Media Studies and an affiliate faculty member in the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, as well as the incoming co-editor of the Journal of Cinema and Media Studies. Their research explores gender and sexuality in digital media and digital cultures. They are the author of three monographs: Video Games Have Always Been Queer (NYU Press, 2019), The Queer Games Avant-Garde: How LGBTQ Game Makers Are Reimagining the Medium of Video Games (2020), and Sex Dolls at Sea: Imagined Histories of Sexual Technologies (MIT Press, 2022). They are also the co-editor of Queer Game Studies (University of Minnesota Press, 2017) and Live Streaming Culture (MIT Press, forthcoming).
