# HELLO AGAIN
Finally feeling better. Today, we'll meet as a group to discuss...
- Affordances in level design
- Laying out your level

# An important design term for us... Affordances!

## Affordances
Affordances are the relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used. It's an incredibly useful way of framing meaningful interaction and design.

# Planning your level: First Steps!

## Layout
_Layout_ refers to a level's overall structure. Laying out a level might include the following phases:
1. Pre-production
2. Parti diagramming
3. Bubble diagramming
4. Floor plan development
5. Markup

## Prototype 1: Reversible Level (Due 03/01)
Using your construction kit, design a level where the player must reach an objective, then return to their starting point. The level must contain unique gameplay in both halves of the experience while retaining the same level layout.
