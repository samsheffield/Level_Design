# HELLO!
Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Discuss puzzles in games

## Puzzles
[This week's notes on puzzles can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eAyKph0SPId6twQ8sl2mqr9YgVyOAahsvfUqWEY4zA4/edit?usp=sharing)

### Quick Activity (10 minutes):
How many examples of different types of puzzles can you think of based on the taxonomy above? Give a specific instance of the puzzle in the game you list and post to the class Discord in #week-12.

## Level Design Prototype 3: Puzzle Level (Due 05/03)

### Description
Design a level around a single type of puzzle. This must accomplish 2 things:
1. It must first teach a new mechanic to the player. (If you use a common mechanic like jumping or shooting, add some novel twist to it!)
2. After teaching the player how to use the mechanic, the level must contain at least two puzzles that rely on understanding of the mechanic to progress.

### Collaboration
Unlike the other two prototypes, I am going to __strongly recommend__ that you collaborate in 2-3 person teams.

# Homework

## Prototype 2: Playtest and leave feedback
I will post playtesting groups here by tomorrow based on the games shared on the MGL Discord. Please play each game you are assigned and leave feedback via the designer's provided feedback form.

I will also begin playtesting games and will make videos/leave feedback in your Google Drive folders like last time.

## Prototype 3: Work on Week 1 Goals

### Brainstorming goals:
- What is the basic concept for your level?
- What kind of mechanic and how will it be used as part of a puzzle?
- What would a player need to know to solve the type of puzzle you want to use?
- Who will you work with? (__If you decide to work alone, please email me to let me know and to confirm that you can manage the workload over the next few weeks.__)

### Prototyping goal
Develop a sandbox scene in Unity which demonstrates the core mechanics needed for your level working together. Upload to a team memberâ€™s folder by start of class on 04/19
