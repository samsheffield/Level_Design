# Sam is STILL sick :(
I thought I was going to feel well enough for tonight's class online, but alas... see you next week.

So let's use the class to introduce some of the concepts we were going to begin discussing anyhow!
- Watch GDC talk: [Empowering the Player: Level Design in N++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ4xevskMCI) (*This is great background working material!*)
- Read _Formal Abstract Design Tools_ by Doug Church ([link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1omZXDeEflB3Si6YbY5YPPp8NoU3nWBK8/view?usp=sharing))
- Complete your Level Design Construction Kit.

## Upload Homework
Haven't uploaded your homework to your class Drive folder yet? Do it first thing for credit:

- __GGJ participant__: Upload a text document with a link to your game and your role(s) in its development
- __Everyone else__: Build of a test scene which shows homework progress since your last in-person or email check-in. Mac or PC, just make sure the build works. __Do not upload entire Unity Project__.

## Open Studio: Complete your Level Construction Kit
- Use tonight's class time to work towards the completion of your kit.
- Reminder: I am not asking you to make a specific game or design an interesting/fun/challenging level with these assets just yet.
- __No email check-in required tonight__

Here's a slightly expanded version the assignment write up again... in handy Google Doc format! Make sure to read it. ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BZsfk_e8M0k95HDvPzLQ_M7i0Ils5grxYJH_0sXMgNk/edit?usp=sharing))
