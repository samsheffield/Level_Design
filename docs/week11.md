# HELLO!
Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Playtest Narrative levels to give both specific and general feedback
- Continue developing level based on feedback

## Playtesting Session

Take turns playtesting each other's games. Both playtesters and designers should have something to take notes with during playtesting.

Before leaving tonight:
- Find (at least) 8 people to exchange playtesting with in class
- Make sure I play your game (you can post a link to the uploaded project on the class Discord if it starts getting late and there is a line! Just let me know)

__Designers...__
- Ask your playtesting questions (__you should have 3__) or direct playtesters to your playtesting form
- Discuss your concept & player experience goals afterwards

__Playtesters...__
- Respond to specific playtesting questions first
- Give general feedback on your experience and how effectively the designer met the narrative level design goals stated below.

### Prototype 2: Narrative Level Design Goals
Build a single level which communicates 3 facts to your player:
- Something that happened to the protagonist of the game in the past.
- Something that happened to a character who is somehow related to the protagonist (for instance: a sibling, friend, enemy, or rival).
- Something about the world in which the game takes place.

## Work Session
Begin working on final iteration based on feedback. This might include work done in Unity, or revisiting your docs, or doing some additional planning.


# Homework

## Prototype 2: Complete Narrative Level
- Do one final iteration of your prototype based on in-class playtesting and upload it to your Google Drive folder by the start of class next week.
- Share links to builds on the MICA Game Lab Discord in one of the playtesting text channels _OR_ find one out-of-class person to playtest IRL and give feedback using your playtesting form (provide link to feedback next week). 

## Organize all Prototype 2 Work
Organize all work related to this project in a __Prototype 2__ folder in your classwork Drive:
- Make a __Planning__  folder and include:
    - Planning docs & floor plans.
    - First pass at level that you made for tonight.
- Make a __Builds__ folder with:
    - Finished prototype builds which you share next week.
- Create a __text document__ which describes:
    - Your concept for the narrative level and its three facts.
    - One additional player experience goal you were designing in your level.
