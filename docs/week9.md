# HELLO!
Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Discuss environmental storytelling
- Work on Prototype 2



## Environmental Storytelling
_Environmental storytelling_ is an approach to narrative in levels that leverages a space and the objects contained within it. It asks the question, “what happened here?”

- What else do you want in your level?

### Prototype 2: Layout goals:

## GMD Talk Wednesday @ 2:30: Old Bones, New #BLUD
![image](/assets/images/blud_promo.png)
Join us for a midday talk this Wednesday (March 23rd) for a talk by Greg Lane (Narrative Designer @ Exit 73 Games) and Chris Burns (Animation Director/Animator @ Exit 73 Studios) about the development of their upcoming game, [#BLUD](http://bludgame.com)!

Originally developed as a cartoon pitch, #BLUD is a top-down adventure game about the perils of tangling with the supernatural on a school night. It draws inspiration from the 90's and early 2000's in its UPA revival art style and writing. In this talk, the folks from Exit 73 games will go over what it's like to build off of nostalgia, and how the interests of your youth can lead to the projects of your future.

This talk will take place on Zoom. Link in class Discord and your email!
